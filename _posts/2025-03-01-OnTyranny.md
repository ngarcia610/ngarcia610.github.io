## Background

Since Trump was elected for a second term, dialogue about fascism has increased. This book is frequently cited as one of the best sources for understanding how tyranny comes into power.

## Main Ideas

Ch. 1: Resist tyranny by being politically active and aware of paramilitary forces. Nazis, communists and fascists come to power piece by piece. Support a multi-party system and avoid one party controlling every level of government.

Ch. 2: Don't ignore dangerous language and symbolism; take a stand against it. The language and symbolism a political party uses may initially seem meaningless or even ridiculous, but these simple tools can lead to profound consequences. An example was marking storefronts in Germany as Jewish or Aryan. Business owners looking for ways out of their economic hardships used it to their advantage, giving legitimacy to an otherwise crazy idea. Submissiveness is still harmful. Refuse to play along.

Ch. 3: Avoid falling victim to propaganda by reading and staying informed. Be an individual. Seek out and express your own ideas. In the book 1984, the ruling party eliminates words to weaken people's minds. One of the best ways to think clearly for yourself is to read books and cut yourself off from the media and Internet.

Ch. 4: Break down social barriers to keep your community alive and healthy. Being connected to your community and uniting over common goals is what unites political parties, which can create change.

Ch. 5: Freedom depends on controlling your information, so protect your privacy. The less control you have over your personal details and correspondence, the more personal freedom you're giving up.

Ch. 6: Be on the lookout for the different ways in which tyrannical leaders distort the truth. There are four stages of truth distortion. 1 - Open hostility to verifiable truth and reality. 2 - Repetition of lies. 3 - Contradictions are openly embraced. 4 - Misplaced faith in leaders who self-proclaim themselves as saviors.
